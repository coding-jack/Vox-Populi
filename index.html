            <p>Vox Populi Translations was founded in 1997, by a group of expert translators who devoted their solemn
              objective to
              competently render accurate communication in every subject matter, between a source language and the
              target language.
              Our linguistics are professional writers with in depth knowledge and consciousness that every message
              needs to be
              translated in a dynamic equivalence with an array of spectrum to retain its content, reproducing the
              original
              semantically, syntactically, etymologically, and idiomatically, thus capturing the true essence of the
              meaning of the
              original message.

            <h2 class="services">Consecutive Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Consecutive Interpretation is a mode of interpretation where the speaker pauses while speaking to allow
              the interpreter
              to convey the message into the target languages. Among many other settings, this type of interpretation is
              generally
              used for smaller gatherings, depositions, immigration proceedings, medical
              appointments, facility tours, business meetings, trainings, and interviews.

            <h2 class="services">Simultaneous Interpretation</h2>
            <p>In the world today, simultaneous interpretation is classified as the most demanding and most cost effect.
              It is used in
              Government settings, and the interpreter has to interpret what the speaker wants to say within the time
              allowed by the
              speaker’s pace, without changing the natural flow of speech. It is the job of the interpreter to deliver
              all semantic
              elements in the speech including its tone. The interpreter also has to deliver the intent of the message
              the speaker
              wants to convey. This type of interpretation requires a super talented professional that only practices
              this
              interpreting mode, and Vox Populi enforces this qualification.

            <h2 class="services">Sight Interpretation</h2>
            <p>A sight translation is an oral translation of a written text. It is as difficult as simultaneous
              interpretation, and
              involves some of the same mental processes. Our interpreters are skillful in pacing the time between
              reading the written
              text while translating mentally and rendering orally the translated version of of the written original
              text, in a time
              manner without distracting the listener. This type of interpretation is often used in Medical, Legal, and
              Business
              fields.

            <p>If you are unavailable to meet face-to-face, choose phone interpretation. Our phone interpreters use the
              consecutive interpretation which means that there is a pause between the conversations for the interpreter
              to render the dialogue into the target language.
              Consecutive interpretation is a mode of interpretation generally used for smaller gatherings, depositions,
              immigration proceedings, medical appointments, facility tours, business meetings, trainings, and
              interviews.

            <p>Our interpreters have excellent listening skills and trained memory, storing all information spoken and
              quickly conveying into the target language. Since phone interpreters cannot see the individual’s body
              language, phone interpreters are also very skilled at differentiating between different tones of voice.
              Our consecutive interpreters maintain strict standards of professionalism, and possess exceptional
              linguistic and interpersonal skills, and have a proud devotion to confidentially.

            <p>Cultural competency is useful for people and business and it is a quick useful understanding of the
              culture, and the way for a clear communication. We provide language classes for those interested in
              traveling overseas who want to be able to confidently communicate with native speakers and have meaningful
              dialogues.
              Communication goes beyond language, and true language competency involves awareness of a culture most
              important traces. It is frustrating when we cannot understand body language, paralanguage, attitude, and
              the cultural aspects of a country we are visiting, and Vox Populi gives competent advice to circumnavigate
              cultural and worldview issues.

            <p>Our philosophy is based upon one-on-one language classes. We understand that learning capability is
              diverse, therefore all lessons are tailored to meet each individual needs. We are closely monitoring the
              development of each individual, evaluating achievements and personal goals leading to their success.
              Our comprehensive language classes use important tools such as audio, video, textbooks, and recorded
              conversation, to practice and improve reading, pronunciation, listening, and speaking.
